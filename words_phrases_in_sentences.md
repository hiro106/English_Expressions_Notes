## Words and phrases which I didn't know or might have forgotten, then want to remember (with contexts)
- str.join() **takes us in the other direction**, **sewing** a list of strings **up into** one long string, using the string it was called on as a separator.  
 - If we want to **throw in** any non-string objects, we have to be careful to call str() on them first.
 - We call .format() on a "format string", **where** the Python values we want to insert are represented with {} placeholders.
 - Notice how we didn't **even** have to call str() to convert position from an int. 
 - format() **takes care of that for** us.
 - **If that was all that** format() **did**, it **would still be** incredibly useful.
 - But **as it turns out**, it can do a lot more. **Here's just a taste**:
 - Anything that is not contained in braces is considered literal text, which **is copied unchanged to the output**. 
 - You could probably write a short book just on str.format, so I'll stop here, and **point you to** pyformat.info and the official docs for further reading.
 - Dictionarie**s** are **a** built-in Python data **structure** for **mapping keys to values**.
 - In this case 'one', 'two', and 'three' are the keys, and 1, 2 and 3 are **their corresponding** values.
 - Values **are accessed via** square bracket syntax similar to **indexing into lists and strings**.
 - Return a **right-justified** string of length width.
 - You are almost **done with** the course. Nice job!
